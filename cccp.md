We'll be utilizing the [CCCP](https://github.com/Soviet-Linux/CCCP) package manager (CCCP Crafter of Controlled Packages), which may use either installer binaries produced with the â€”create argument or sources from a .spm (soviet package manager) file. 


Here is a list of the parameters that may be used with the CCCP.:
1. --install (installs a .spm files)
1. --binary (installs a binary package in .tar.gz format)

See the [documentation](https://docs.sovietlinux.ml/repo) for information on how to create a package.
