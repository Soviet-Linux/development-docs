This is the primary repository for CCCP and Soviet Linux. Because the CCCP was cluttered, we decided to separate the package files.

The CCCP is the official Soviet Linux package manager, and it is capable of installing .spm files. See also [CCCP](https://soviet-linux.github.io/delevopment-docs/cccp)
